<b>NAME</b>
       rm - remove files or directories

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       rm [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.
       By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the -I or --interactive = once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r,  -R,
       or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option  is  not
       given, or the -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to
       remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              prompt before every removal

       <b>-I</b>     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively;
              less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       <b>-r, -R, --recursive</b>
              remove directories and their contents recursively


       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option  to  remove
       each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To  remove  a  file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its  contents,
       given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly
       unrecoverable, consider using shred.
