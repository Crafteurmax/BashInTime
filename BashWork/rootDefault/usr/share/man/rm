<b>NAME</b>
       rm - remove files or directories

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       rm [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of <b>rm</b>.  <b>rm</b> removes each specified file.
       By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the <b>-I</b> or <b>--interactive</b>=<u>once</u> option is given, and there are more than three files or the <b>-r</b>,  <b>-R</b>,
       or <b>--recursive</b> are given, then <b>rm</b> prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

option  is  not
       given, or the <b>-i</b> or <b>--interactive</b>=<u>always</u> option is given, <b>rm</b> prompts the user for whether to
       remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              prompt before every removal

       <b>-I</b>     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively;
              less intrusive than <b>-i</b>, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       <b>-r</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              remove directories and their contents recursively


       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the <b>--recursive</b> (<b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b>) option  to  remove
       each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To  remove  a  file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm <b>-- -foo</b>

              rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its  contents,
       given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly
       unrecoverable, consider using shred.
