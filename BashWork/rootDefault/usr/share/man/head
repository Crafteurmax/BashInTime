<b>NAME</b>
       head - output the first part of files

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       head [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede
       each with a header giving the file name.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       <b>-c, --bytes=[-]NUM</b>
              print the first NUM bytes of each file; with the leading '-', print all but the last
              NUM bytes of each file

       <b>--lines=[-]NUM</b>
              print  the  first NUM lines instead of the first 10; with the leading '-', print all
              but the last NUM lines of each file

       <b>-q, --quiet, --silent</b>
              never print headers giving file names


       NUM may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB  1000*1000,  M  1024*1024,
       GB, 1000*1000*1000,  G  1024*1024*1024,  and  so  on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can
       be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
