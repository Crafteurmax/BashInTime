<b>NAME</b>
       touch - change file timestamps

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       touch [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>FILE</u>...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of
       the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       <b>-c, --no-create</b>
              do not create any files

       <b>-d, --date=STRING</b>
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       <b>-m</b>     change only the modification time

       <b>-r, --reference=FILE</b>
              use this file's times instead of current time

<b>DATE STRING</b>
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun,  29  Feb
       2004  16:21:42  -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may
       contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time,
       relative  date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date
       string format is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in  the
       info documentation.
