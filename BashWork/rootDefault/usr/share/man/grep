<b>NAME</b>
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       grep [<u>OPTION</u>...] PATTERNS [<u>FILE</u>...]
       grep [<u>OPTION.</u>..] <b>-e</b> <u>PATTERNS</u> ... [<u>FILE</u>...]
       grep [<u>OPTION</u>...] <b>-f</b> <u>PATTERN_FILE</u> ... [<u>FILE</u>...]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>grep</b>  searches  for  <u>PATTERNS</u>  in each <u>FILE</u>.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated
       by newline characters, and <b>grep</b> prints each line that matches a pattern. Typically  <u>PATTERNS</u>
       should be quoted when <b>grep</b> is used in a shell command.

       A  <u>FILE</u>  of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the
       working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input. In addition, the variant
       programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are the same as <b>grep -E</b>,  <b>grep -F</b>, and  <b>grep -r</b>,  respectively.
       These variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
   Matching Control
      <b>-e</b> <u>PATTERNS</u>, <b>--regexp</b>=<u>PATTERNS</u>
              Use  <u>PATTERNS</u> as the patterns.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with
              the <b>-f</b> (<b>--file</b>) option, search for all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a
              pattern beginning with “-”.

       <b>-f</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Obtain  patterns  from <u>FILE</u>, one per line. If this option is used multiple times or is
              combined with the <b>-e</b> (<b>--regexp</b>) option, search for all patterns given. The empty file
              contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
              Ignore  case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in
              case they match each other.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match</b>
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

General Output Control
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
              With the <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match</b> option (see below), count non-matching lines.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--files-without-match</b>
              Suppress  normal  output;  instead  print  the name of each input file from which no
              output would normally have been printed.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--files-with-matches</b>
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which  output
              would normally have been printed.  Scanning each input file stops upon the first match.

       <b>-m</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--max-count</b>=<u>NUM</u>
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines. If the input is standard input from a regular
              file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned
              to just after the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing
              context lines. This enables a calling process to resume a search. When grep stops after
              <u>NUM</u> matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines. When the <b>-c</b> or <b>--count</b> option is
              also used, grep does not output a count greater than NUM. When the <b>-v</b> or <b>--invert-match</b>
              option is also used, grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.

   Output Line Prefix Control
       <b>-n</b>, <b>--line-number</b>
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

   File and Directory Selection
       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on
              the command line. Note that if no file operand is given, B<grep> searches the working
              directory. This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--dereference-recursive</b>
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow all symbolic links, unlike <b>-r</b>.

<b>PATTERNS</b>
       For more information on PATTERNS, use <b>man grep_pattern</b>

<b>EXIT STATUS</b>
       Normally  the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if
       an error occurred.  However, if the -q or <b>--quiet</b>  or  <b>--silent</b>  is  used  and  a  line  is
       selected, the exit status is 0 even if an error occurred.
